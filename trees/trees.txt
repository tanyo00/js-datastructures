Trees
- Each Node has 1 parent and 0 or more childs
- Root Node (starting node)
- Leafs (Nodes without child nodes)


Binary Tree (BT)
- Includes all Tree rules
- Each Node can have maximum of 2 child nodes


Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Includes all Binary Tree rules
- Smaller values on the left
- Bigger values on the right

Traversal(loop through nodes of the tree):
- Pre-Order(root, left, right)
- In-Order(left, root, right) (from smallest to the biggest one)
- Post-Order (left, right, root)
- Level-Order(Breadth-First Search)

Operations(methods):
- insert 
- delete
- contains
- size
- max
- min
- BFS
- preOrder
- inOrder
- postOrder
